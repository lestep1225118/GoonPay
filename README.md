# GoonBucks Frontend

The GoonBucks frontend is a React + Vite web application that provides two interfaces:

1. **Professor Dashboard** — award GoonBucks, manage students, and create marketplace items.
2. **Student Portal** — view balances, browse marketplace items, and redeem rewards.

This frontend communicates with the GoonBucks backend through a REST API.
